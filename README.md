Consuming the [API from Chicago Art Institute](https://api.artic.edu/docs/).

### Introduction
The [Art Institute of Chicago's](https://www.artic.edu/) API provides JSON-formatted data as a REST-style service that allows developers to explore and integrate the museumâ€™s public data into their projects. This API is the same tool that powers their [website](https://www.artic.edu/), their [mobile app](https://www.artic.edu/visit/explore-on-your-own/mobile-app-audio-tours), and many other technologies in the museum.
